# Meetings JavaScript Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you creating a meeting on the platform in just a few minutes. Let's get started.

!!! warning "This is for RingCentral Meetings. Looking for the RingCentral Video API?"
     This guide to creating meetings is designed for **RingCentral Meetings**. If you are looking to get started using our built-from-the-ground-up RingCentral Video API, [request access today](https://forms.gle/Pk7pNMwky8di5LCR8)!

??? check "Meetings Permission Required"
     In order to use this API, developers must have a paid RingCentral account. This API is not available to free developer accounts.

## Create an App

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Meetings App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "API App for RingCentral Office" under "What type of app are you creating?"</li>
<li>Select "Other Non-UI" under "Where will you be calling the API from?"
<li>Select "Only members of my organization/company" under "Who will be authorized to access your app?"
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard, enter your app's name and description. Then select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>Meetings</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Create a Meeting

### Install RingCentral JavaScript SDK

```bash
$ npm install @ringcentral/sdk --save
```

### Create and Edit meetings.js

Create a file called `meetings.js`. Be sure to edit the variables in ALL CAPS with your app and user credentials.

```javascript
const SDK = require('@ringcentral/sdk').SDK

RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID = '<ENTER CLIENT ID>'
RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET = '<ENTER CLIENT SECRET>'
RINGCENTRAL_SERVER = 'https://platform.ringcentral.com'

RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME = '<YOUR ACCOUNT PHONE NUMBER>'
RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD = '<YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD>'
RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION = '<YOUR EXTENSION, PROBABLY "101">'

var rcsdk = new SDK({
    server: RINGCENTRAL_SERVER,
    clientId: RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID,
    clientSecret: RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET
});
var platform = rcsdk.platform();
platform.login({
    username: RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME,
    password: RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD,
    extension: RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION
    })
    .then(function(resp) {
	platform.post('/restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/meeting', {
            topic: 'Test Meeting',
            meetingType: 'Instant',
            allowJoinBeforeHost: true,
            startHostVideo: true,
            startParticipantsVideo: false
	      })
        .then(function(resp) {
          return resp.json()
        })
        .then(function (json) {
            console.log('Start Your Meeting: ' + json.links.startUri )
            console.log('Join the Meeting: ' + json.links.joinUri )
        });
});
```

### Run Your Code

You are almost done. Now run your script.

```bash
$ node meetings.js
```
